# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to assist Pewlett Hackard in dealing with potential reitrees within the company and coming up with solutions to help fill these future positions. We were given the assignment of determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identifing the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will help ease the transition of the "Silver Tsunanmi".
# Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
In the first deliverable we were able to filter the data to show which employees were "baby booomers" or born between 1952 and 1955. This allows us to gain an idea of how many employees may be up for retirement.

Additionally, we dropped any employees who have already left the company to limit unnecessary data, then we created a table to show how many potential retirees there are based on their position title.

In the second deliverable we created a table that shows individuals who are eilgible for mentorship based on if they were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965, and is still a current employee. We were then able to order the table based on employee number in ascending order.

# Summary:
When referring to the retiring_titles table, it appears there are potentially around 72,000 employees about to retire from Pewlett Hackard. The majority of individuals appear to hold higher positions such as 'Senior Engineer' (25.9k) and 'Senior Staff'(24.9k). When creating a another table to count how many potential mentors there are it shows 1,549. This does not appear to be enough employee mentors for all of the future open positions. One potential solution is to expand the age range to include more employees in the mentorship to make up for all of the retirees. Another solution could be to divide up the 1,549 mentors according to the percentage of indivualds retiring in each of the 7 positons.
